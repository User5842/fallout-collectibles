# Fallout Collectibles

## A bit of background

The idea for a simple application that would allow users to track collectibles found in the various Fallout games was always something I wanted to do. It seemed simple enough, and it would be a fun hobby project to work on, especially since I am a massive fan of the series.

I have tried many times in the past, with varying degrees of success, but this time, I want to make it happen.

I've been trying to dive deeper into system design recently, to improve my skills as a software engineer and after a couple of weeks of reading DDIA, reading through articles on Hello Interview and watching more YouTube videos on the subject (hello, Jordan Has No Life), I felt that it would be appropriate for me to apply some of my newfound knowledge.
